  <h2>How to play War</h2>
  <p>
    1. Click on your respective decks to begin the game <br>
    
    2. Each player will send one card into the middle pile. <br>
    
    3. Whoever has the higher card collects both cards in the middle. <br>
    
    4. If both players send a card into the middle that are of the <br> same value, then each player must four cards and whoever has <br> the highest fourth card wins the cards played in the middle. <br>
    
    5. The game continues until one player has ran out of cards to play, <br> which will result in that player losing. <br>
    Have Fun!

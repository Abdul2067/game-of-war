  <h2>How to play War</h2>
  
  <p>
    1. Each player will recieve half a deck of cards. <br>

    2. Click on your respective decks to begin the game. <br>
    
    3. Each player will send one card into the middle pile. <br>
    
    4. Whoever has the higher card collects both cards in the middle. <br>
    
    5. If both players send a card into the middle that are of the <br> same value, then each player must play four cards and whoever <br> has the highest fourth card wins the cards played in the middle. <br>
    
    6. The game continues until one player has ran out of cards to play, <br> which will result in that player losing. <br>

    7. Tired of clicking, find the easter egg, sit back and watch the cards go! <br>
    Have Fun!
